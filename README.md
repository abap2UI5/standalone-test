# abap2UI5-local — `702` branch

Ready-to-install [abap2UI5](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5) **downported for old releases (NetWeaver 7.02 and higher)**, generated from **abap2UI5 v1.144.0**.

The complete framework is merged into the local classes of a single HTTP handler class (`if_http_extension`) and automatically downported to 7.02 syntax with [abaplint](https://abaplint.org) — no other abap2UI5 installation is required, and your app stays completely independent of the rest of the system.

#### What's inside

| Object | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Z2UI5_CL_ABAP2UI5_LOCAL` | Class | HTTP handler (`if_http_extension`) — the entire framework lives in its local classes, in 7.02-compatible syntax |
| `Z2UI5_T_99` | Table | Persistence for draft/session data |
| `Z2UI5_T_98` | Table | Utility persistence |
| `z2ui5_local` | ICF node | Service path `/sap/bc/z2ui5_local`, already wired to the handler class |

#### Installation

**Option A — abapGit (recommended):** pull this branch into your system.

**Option B — copy & paste:** create the handler class manually and copy the sources from `src/`, then create the two tables (DDL in the [main README](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5-local#persistence)) and an ICF node pointing to the class.

#### Getting started

1. Activate the ICF node in transaction `SICF`: locate `/sap/bc/z2ui5_local`, right-click → *Activate Service*.
2. Create your app as a class (or local class) implementing `z2ui5_if_app` from the locals of the handler.
3. Open it in the browser:

```
https://<host>:<port>/sap/bc/z2ui5_local?sap-client=<client>&app_start=<your_app_class>
```

#### Sibling branches

| Branch | Use when |
|---|---|
| [`standard`](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5-local/tree/standard) | Your system runs a recent Standard ABAP release |
| [`cloud`](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5-local/tree/cloud) | You are on ABAP for Cloud / BTP ABAP Environment |

#### About this branch

This branch is **generated** — the [generate_702](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5-local/actions/workflows/generate_702.yaml) workflow merges the upstream sources with [abapmerge](https://github.com/larshp/abapmerge), downports and lints them with [abaplint](https://abaplint.org) and force-pushes the result as a single commit on top of `main`. Do not open pull requests against it: changes belong in [`main`](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5-local) (tooling) or in [abap2UI5](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5) (framework).

#### Issues

For bug reports or feature requests, please open an issue in the [abap2UI5 repository](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5/issues).
